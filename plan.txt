two node.js scripts running on the same machine as a database

both accessing it locally (that way we don't have to screw around with remote db connection)

if we ever need to move the database to a different computer, we will figure it out!

csv files are made by the client, sent to the IO server, and put in the database

when the IODevTools are accessed, csv files will queried as neccessary
